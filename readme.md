# The bread factory

### Description of project
This small project looks at using functions and TDD . We're also implementing.

Topics covered include:
- Functions
- TDD
- Documentation
- Agile 
- Scrum

## Functions
functions are like people at work. They have ONE JOB!

### How do they work?
1) We need to define them,
2) then call them.
3) They run the block that is indented.

Other functionality:
- They can take in arguments to be dynamic or morph the output

If a variable is like a box, you name it and place things inside. The box does NOT interact with your stuff. For example, if you nam a bax "Books" and place some potatoes inside, you do not get french fries.

A **function is like a machine**. It can interact with things you put inside. It can take and follow a set of instructions (AKA the clock of code)

#### Why functions?
Because is keeps our code DRY:
- Don't
- Repeat
- Yourself

Allowing us to call said function to do the actions in block.

#### best practices of function
- name convention in python is like a variable, lower_case_underscore()
- IT DOES ONE JOB! ONE!
- DONT PRINT IN FUNCTIONS.
- Seperation of concerns principle (exists at network and infrastructure level and code level)
    - helps remove single point of failure in code,
    - makes code more maintainable
    - 
    
## Basis of test
A test has known or controlled inputs and expected outputs. All it is, is an assertion. In coding testing is an assertion.

Unit test is the testing of one single function.

You give it a known input, and
